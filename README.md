### 🖥️ [perfect-setup/](./perfect-setup)

**Your Personal Remote Development Server** - The game-changing setup that lets you run **AI coding agents 24/7 in persistent tmux sessions**, managed from any device.

**🚀 The Revolutionary Workflow:**
1. **Assign Tasks to AI Agents** - Start Claude Code, Copilot CLI, or Gemini CLI in tmux
2. **Let Them Work** - AI agents write code while you're away
3. **Check Progress Anywhere** - Review from phone, tablet, or any browser
4. **Give Feedback & New Tasks** - Test results, assign next tasks, repeat

**Why This Changes Everything:** Without AI agents, you need to be at your PC to write code. With this setup, **AI agents write code for you** while you guide, review, and test from anywhere. This is "vibe coding"—managing AI workers instead of writing code yourself.

**What's Inside:**
- 🤖 **AI Coding Agents** - Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI in persistent tmux sessions
- 📱 **Remote Management** - Check progress from phone, assign tasks from tablet
- 🌐 **Access Anywhere** - Full VS Code Server in browser, SSH from any device
- 🔐 **Secure VPN** - Tailscale for zero-config connections (no port forwarding!)
- 📂 **Multi-Project** - Multiple AI agents on different projects simultaneously
- 🐳 **Complete Stack** - WSL2, Docker, tmux, systemd, optional GPU acceleration

**Perfect For:** Any developer who wants AI agents to write code while they focus on architecture, review, and testing—accessible from anywhere.

**Key Benefit:** Your personal AI coding farm. Multiple agents working 24/7 on different projects. Zero ongoing costs. Manage from any device worldwide.

### 🤖 [ai-agents/](./ai-agents)

**AI Agents: From Zero to Hero** - Learn to build production AI agents by understanding *why* you need frameworks, not just *how* to use them.

> 🔗 **Featured on LinkedIn:** [Read the full announcement](https://lnkd.in/dDJE6VZH)

**🎯 The Philosophy:**

Do you know exactly what happens when you send a message to ChatGPT? Most tutorials hide the complexity behind libraries. "Just import this framework and run." 

**I believe the best way to learn is to build it from scratch, locally, and watch the variables change in the debugger.**

**Don't use AI frameworks blindly. Learn *why* you need them first.** 🛠️

**🗺️ The Roadmap - From Raw Python to Production:**

Most tutorials jump straight into complex frameworks, leaving you confused about what's actually happening. This repo takes the opposite approach.

We build from the ground up:

1. **The Foundation:** Raw HTTP calls and OOP Python classes ✅ *Available now!*
2. **The Mechanics:** Manual tool calling and recursion ✅ *Available now!*
3. **The Realization:** Understanding *why* manual state management gets messy
4. **The Solution:** Introducing Frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI) ✅ *Available now!*
5. **The Knowledge:** RAG Systems with vector databases ✅ *Available now!*
6. **The Combination:** Integrating RAG with Agent Frameworks ✅ *Available now!*
7. **The Voice:** Complete Voice Assistant ✅ *Available now!*
8. **The Memory:** Long-term context with Letta (MemGPT) 🚧 *Coming soon*

**📚 What's Inside:**
- 📚 **00-llm-basics** - Understanding stateless LLMs and API fundamentals
- 🔧 **01-tool-calling** - Function calling and recursive agent loops
- 🕸️ **02-agent-frameworks** - LangChain, LangGraph & CrewAI (Modern LCEL)
- 📊 **03-embeddings-rag** - Vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation
- 🔗 **04-integrated-agents** - Combining RAG with CrewAI agent frameworks
- 🎙️ **05-voice-assistant** - Complete voice assistant (Whisper + LangGraph + TTS)
- 🧠 **04-memory-systems** (Coming Soon) - Long-term memory with Letta (MemGPT)

**🎓 How to Use This Repo:**
1. **Read the README** in each folder for the theory
2. **Run the Code** with a debugger to see the practice
3. **Study the Comments** - Extensive explanations in every script

**💻 Tech Stack:** 100% Local with Ollama & Qwen. **No API keys required.**

**🔍 Learning Philosophy:**
- ✅ Build from scratch before using frameworks
- ✅ Debugger-friendly code with extensive comments
- ✅ curl examples for every HTTP endpoint
- ✅ Real-world examples from production systems
- ✅ Understand the "why" not just the "how"
